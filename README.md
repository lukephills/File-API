#FILE API - LOADING AUDIO

Example loading audio files using the file API


### Development

Install the node modules:
`npm install`

Install Webpack:
`npm install -g webpack`

Run webpack watch:
`webpack --watch`

Every time a typescript file is saved, Webpack will bundle all dependencies into a minified `bundle.js` file and create sourcemaps for debugging. In dev tools look at `webpack://` in the Sources panel.
